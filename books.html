		<h1> <center> Em's Fiction Book Recommendations</h1>
			<p> <right> The fiction books I recommend is a triology called Crazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan. This series is about a woman named Rachel Chu, a professor of economics, who's boyfriend is named Nick Young. Nick Young is invited to his best friends wedding, and Rachel comes along. To her astonishment, Rachel realizes that Nick's standard of living is on an entirely different level. Along many obstacles, She navigates through this big change in her and her boyfriends life.
